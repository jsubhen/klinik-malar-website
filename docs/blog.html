      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">ðŸ¦· The Importance of Regular Teeth Cleaning</h2>
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">Regular teeth cleaning, also known as dental scaling and polishing, is one of the most effective ways to maintain good oral hygiene. At Klinik Pergigian Malar, we recommend visiting your dentist every 6 months to remove plaque and tartar buildup that brushing alone cannot eliminate.</p>
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">Not only does this help prevent cavities and gum disease, but it also keeps your breath fresh and your smile bright. Our experienced team ensures that every cleaning session is gentle, thorough, and tailored to your needs.</p>
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">If you're due for a cleaning or haven't seen a dentist in a while, book your appointment today. Early prevention is always better than treatment!</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">ðŸ¦· How to Help Children Feel Comfortable at the Dentist</h2>
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">Many children feel nervous about going to the dentist. At Klinik Pergigian Malar, we focus on creating a calm, friendly environment to make every child feel safe and supported.</p>
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">We recommend introducing children to the dentist at an early age â€” ideally by their first birthday â€” and making visits a positive routine. Bring a comfort toy, explain the visit in fun language, and reward them with praise after.</p>
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">Our team uses gentle techniques and kid-friendly communication to ensure every young patient leaves with a smile. We're proud to be a family-focused clinic in Rawang!</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">ðŸ¦· Understanding Tooth Sensitivity and What You Can Do</h2>
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">Do you feel a sharp pain when eating or drinking something hot, cold, sweet, or sour? You might be experiencing tooth sensitivity â€” a common but treatable issue.</p>
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">Common causes include worn enamel, exposed tooth roots, cavities, or recent dental procedures. Using a desensitizing toothpaste, avoiding acidic foods, and maintaining gentle brushing habits can help.</p>
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">If sensitivity persists, our clinic can recommend targeted treatments such as fluoride varnishes, bonding, or gum treatments to protect sensitive areas and improve your comfort.</p>
